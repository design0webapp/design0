## What I Built

As a non-professional designer seeking to create attractive posts and cover images for my blogs and projects, I envisioned a tool that would allow me to select a base image, highlight specific areas, and use natural language to instruct AI on desired edits, overcoming the unpredictability of current text-to-image generators.

Enter Design0â€”an AI-powered design tool I built to simplify image editing with natural language commands. Using Design0, you can search an image database by description. Once you've found your image, simply drag and drop to mask areas for editing, then write prompts describing your desired changes. Click "Edit" and watch the magic unfold! ðŸŽ‰
